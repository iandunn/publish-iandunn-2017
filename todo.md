### High

* comment author name should be top-aligned w/ gravatar


### Medium

* `code a` vs `a code` - the link colors are different. The blue is probably better
	* https://iandunn.localhost/2016/10/22/accessing-post-meta-and-more-via-post-meta_key/
* disable parent theme javascript and rewrite in native js. will be 1k instead of 115k b/c don't need jquery.
* add something to visually separate comments from each other. maybe alternating bg color?



### Low

* entry meta
	* move date to just below post title, because very important to determine if relevant to user
	* title should be link to the post on single view
	* change "bookmark the permalink" to just "permalink"
	* remove "by ian dunn" b/c all posts are
	* tags/cats on new line

* highlight .bypostauthor in some way? maybe same bgcolor as sticky posts?

* logged in as iandunn - only iandunn should be link

* archives page - maybe hide tags with less than X posts on mobile?
