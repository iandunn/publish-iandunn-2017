### High



### Medium

* disable parent theme javascript and rewrite in native js. will be 1k instead of 115k b/c don't need jquery.
* add something to visually separate comments from each other. maybe alternating bg color?
* build custom widgets in mu-plugin for the social profiles and the mailchimp subscribe, use them instead of text widget
* keep both new_wp_trim_excerpt() and the bit in show_excerpts() ?


### Low

* entry meta
	* move date to just below post title, because very important to determine if relevant to user
	* title should be link to the post on single view
	* change "bookmark the permalink" to just "permalink"
	* remove "by ian dunn" b/c all posts are
	* tags/cats on new line

* highlight .bypostauthor in some way? maybe same bgcolor as sticky posts?

* logged in as iandunn - only iandunn should be link

* archives page - maybe hide tags with less than X posts on mobile?
